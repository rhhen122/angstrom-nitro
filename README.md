This is Nitro! Imagine rendering a Webpage with JS! Yeah you probably hate it already...
"WTF WHY DID YOU MAKE THIS!?" Because I wanted to use logic and dynamic stuff without having to constantly link JS and HTML.

## Tools
Tools allow the dev to test and show off their crappy little websites

### List of Tools
 - View (Brings up a preview of your website at <a href='http://localhost:8888/'>localhost:8888</a>)
 - Ship (Ships your files into a 'app' folder)
 - Git (Send out git commits)
 - Deploy (Deploy git commits and tags)

'It was only about a day before nitro start ruining its self' - Me

## Notes
Docs contains an example of how a Nitro site "should be"

## Using this SOB
Copy from the /src/ dir in the git repo whatever you need! FYI: main.js and index.html need each other to work!
```
$ curl -o http://link.to.main.file/
```
